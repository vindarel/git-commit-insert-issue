* Search and insert the right issue at "Fixes #"

Goal: In a magit commit buffer, I want to complete the issue when I type
"Fixes #".

For Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket.

For both,  it works for individual  or group projects. For  Gitlab, it
works with private projects.

** Usage
Activate the minor mode
: M-x git-commit-insert-issue-mode

In a magit  commit buffer (=git-commit-mode=), type "Fixes  #" (or [[https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/][any
other keyword understood by github]], or just a "#" for Gitlab) and choose
the issue from the list.

So to always activate it:
: (add-hook 'git-commit-mode-hook 'git-commit-insert-issue-mode)

You can also call it with
: M-x git-commit-insert-issue-ask-issues

and programmatically doing something like
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(--map (insert (concat it "\n"))
       (git-commit-insert-issue-github-issues-format "inkel" "github-issues.el"))
#+END_SRC

*** Connect to your Gitlab account
Don't forget to set your Gitlab credentials:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq gitlab-host "https://gitlab.com"
      gitlab-username "foo"
      gitlab-password "password")
#+END_SRC
normally you would then call =M-x gitlab-login=, but the lib does it when needed.

** Installation

This package is in [[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/MELPA][MELPA]], so you can install it with [[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el][package.el]]:

: M-x package-install RET git-commit-insert-issue RET

(you may need a =M-x package-refresh-contents=).

Alternatively, you can download this  repo and call =M-x load-file= on the
elisp source.

*** Dependencies

- [[https://github.com/inkel/github-issues.el][github-issues]]
- helm
- projectile
- s.el
- [[https://github.com/nlamirault/emacs-gitlab][emacs-gitlab]] (see also [[https://gitlab.com/tarsius/glab][glab.el]], by Tarsius, Emacs 25 only)

They are all in MELPA.

_Feedback on emacs-gitlab_: it's very  well written but monolithic and
not  very flexible.   It has  functions for  every action  of the  api
(glab.el  takes  another  approach,   the  developer  writes  the  api
endpoint) but it seems it wasn't  written for practical stuff in mind.
For  example, it  didn't have  an option  to fetch  only the  /opened/
issues of a project, or optional  function arguments to make it easier
to develop. See [[https://github.com/nlamirault/emacs-gitlab/pull/40][this PR]] as an example.

Doc  is  missing, but  once  you  understand  that  a project  can  be
referenced by "username/project", it's easier.

** Issues

- the [[https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/git-commit-insert-issue/issues/5][helm integration is broken]], we then simply use ido.
- if you play too much with it, you can reach github's rate limit.

[[https://github.com/inkel/github-issues.el/issues][Issues for github integration of github-issues.el]] :

# export: both uses an org table with many columns. Eval with C-c-c or
# execute the line with C-x-e
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(--map (insert (concat it "\n")) (git-commit-insert-issue-github-issues-format "inkel" "github-issues.el"))
#10 - Why not just use the gh package?
#1 - Doesn't work on private repos.
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
;;(issues-get-issues "inkel" "github-issues.el")
#+END_SRC


** Todo

- tests
- cache
- [X] gitlab integration:
  - [X] Get opened issues from gitlab
  - [X] Get a list of strings with "id - title"
  - [X] choose with ido and insert in buffer: =M-x git-commit-insert-issue-gitlab-insert=.
  - [X] choose github or gitlab, depending on project.
    - [X] get the remote server in git config
  - [X]  make it work for  projects in groups (i.e,  "emacs-stuff/project" and
    not "vindarel".
    - [X] get the group name in git config
  - [±] error handling (bad project name, etc)
